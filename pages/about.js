            Climate is the long-term pattern of weather in a particular area.
            Weather can change from hour-to-hour, day-to-day, month-to-month or
            even year-to-year. A region’s weather patterns, usually tracked for
            at least 30 years, are considered its climate. Different parts of
            the world have different climates. Some parts of the world are hot
            and rainy nearly every day. They have a tropical wet climate. Others
            are cold and snow-covered most of the year. They have a polar
            climate. Between the icy poles and the steamy tropics are many other
            climates that contribute to Earth’s biodiversity and geologic
            heritage. Climate is determined by a region’s climate system.
